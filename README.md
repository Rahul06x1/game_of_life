# GAME OF LIFE

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Python.

## Rules

1) If a cell is ALIVE and has fewer than two neighbors that are ALIVE, it turns DEAD
2) If a cell is ALIVE and has either two or three neighbors that are ALIVE, it remains ALIVE.
3) If a cell is ALIVE and has more than three neighbors that are ALIVE, it turns DEAD.
4) If a cell is DEAD and has exactly three neighbors that are ALIVE, it turns ALIVE.

## Running the game

The application is a very simple version of Conway's 'game of life'. To see what the game does, go to the game_of_life directory and run ```python3 game_of_life.py```.
